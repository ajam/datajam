### About

Data from the [Payday Nation](http://projects.aljazeera.com/2014/payday-nation/index.html) project, published June 17, 2014. The data was, in part, obtained via a Freedom of Information request to the Federal Trade Commission by Julia Harte, Joanna Zuckerman Bernstein & Nick Nehamas and was combined with subsequent reporting to link payday lending companies to their associated tribe. Geocoding was performed using [Texas A&M GeoServices](http://geoservices.tamu.edu/). OCR was performed by [ABBYY FineReader Express](http://abbyy.com).

The stories and graphics for [Payday Nation](http://projects.aljazeera.com/2014/payday-nation/index.html) were reported and produced in collaboration with the Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism at Columbia University in New York.

### Caveats

These complaints have not been investigated by the FTC nor have they been independently verified.

# What's here? 

This data powers the interactive [on this page](http://projects.aljazeera.com/2014/payday-nation/complaints.html). This repo contains two groups of data: 

1. Detailed complaints against ten payday lending companies including the text of the consumer's complaint: `detailed-complaint-texts.csv` and associated PDF and RTF files.
2. Less detailed but more comprehensive data showing the city and state of complaints against a much larger group of payday lenders: `pdl-complaints.csv`.
3. Topojson files of US states. `us-states.json` has land and state areas. `us.json` has counties as well.

Both datasets cover complaints issued between February 2013 and February 2014.

## Detailed complaint text data

The detailed data includes full text complaints from the following companies, which are associated with Native American tribes:

File descriptions:

* `Complaints FOIA.pdf` - Complaints filed with the FTC against the companies affiliated with the Wakpamni Lake Community of the Oglala Sioux Tribe.
* `Complaints FOIA.rtf` - An OCRd version of `Complaints FOIA.pdf`
* `Full Complaints.pdf` - Complaints filed with the FTC against the other companies listed above.
* `Full Complaints.rtf` - An OCRd version of `Full Complaints.pdf`

Also includes complaint metadata including reference number, consumer age range, consumer city and consumer state (with lat/lngs), affiliated tribe, tribe city and state, loan amount requested, and loan amount paid.

## Less detailed geographic data

File description: 

* `pdl-complaints.csv` - A list of all complaints against the 23 tribes, listed below, between February 2013 and February 2014. This data is not as detailed as the PDF complaints but it contains information on more companies. Obtaining full complaint data for every complaint would have significantly delayed the project.
