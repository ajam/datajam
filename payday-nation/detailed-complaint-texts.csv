Was put back on hold to check on the loan and then told that their IRS department is requiring me to pay an additional $190 before they release the funds into my account and again this would be refunded back now increasing my loan to $3,340.

The parent company is Wakpamini Lake Community Corporation. When the funds were not received in my checking account after all requirements were met, I inquired about the status of the loan and discovered that the money had been deposited into another account that does not belong to me. However, when I applied for the first loan, paid back in full by me, and the second loan, my online applications included my checking account routing and account number with GNO Federal Credit Union. Through emails I informed them that the money was deposited into an account that did not belong to me and I was informed the loan would be cancelled when the money returned to them, which apparently never happened. Because I received no help from them with this matter, and because I had access to the account information, which was attached to my name, on 8/23/13 I called the fraud department with US Bank, the financial institution for the account in question and discussed this matter with Tamara. She verified for me that the account information I gave to her was an active account with their bank and further verified that it did not belong to me nor was I an authorized user. I asked for documentation from Tamara to provide to the loan company but she told me that because I was not a customer, she could not file a fraud complaint nor provide me anything in writing. After further discussion with Tamara about this matter, she informed me that her supervisor, Geneva Blackburn, informed her that the loan company could call with my name and/or social security number and they would verify with them verbally that this was not my account nor was I an authorized user.
